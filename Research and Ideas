Need to be above 30 war:


Add names of people who are not active players who are (Not currently in hall of Fame, and did not take steroids, as far as you know, and are good people)






Different Baseball Eras:

PRE-MLB Era:  1850-1901


Dead Ball Era: 1900-1919    Ball where poorly design and overused in games
A single baseball would often be in play over 100 pitches, baseball got soft so they did not fly as far games were slower, less entertaining, more focused on strategy then just playing the game of baseball

Pitchers where allowed to do what ever they wanted to the ball, scuff it split ball, scuffs

Homeruns and base hits super rare 

Batting avg dropped to 0.239

Players that got on base bunted, took walks, stole bases



Underrated played from this time not in hall of fame

cheif Wilson - Most triples in a season with 36 in 1912




Live ball Era: 1920-1941

Extreme rise in offensive statistics, records being broken 

Pitches were NO longer allowed to miniplate the baseballs, also baseballs were to be swapped out during the first sign of wear so they would be easier to see and the balls were not soft because they kept getting changed out so the balls would go alot further and be hit harder


This is when power became the most important batting statistics as seen with players like Babe Ruth (He is in the Hall of Fame)



Integration Era: 1942-1960

The color barrier begins to be broken in MLB, Jackie Robinson (HOF player) being signed to the Dodgers by GM Branch Rickey 

1947 April 15th The color barriers was officially broken (Jackie Robinson first game) With Brooklyn Dodgers

Paved the way for players for future players to get a chance

Larry Doby, Satchel Paige, Roy Campanella (All 3 HOF)

Latin American players also start to get signed as well Roberto Clemente (HOF pureto Rico)


Expansion Era: 1961-1976

A whole bunch of new teams where added 




Pitching Era: 1963-1968

Occurred during the Expansion Era

The strike zone was changed to be significantly bigger due to it being now from the shoulders to the bottom of the knees, instead of where it was before, which was the armpits, to the top of the knees

Pitching dominations

Record low Batting average: 0.237

Major league stars during this time Sandy Koufax (1.93 ERA and 4 no hitters and a perfect game in 1963), Bob Gibson (1.12 ERA)



1969 The pitching mound was lowered from 15 inch's to 10 inches

DH was a new rule that was added


Free Agent Era: 1977-1986

Players had much more negotiating power, and more freedom to where to sign,
First million-dollar player Nolan Ryan (4.5 million dollar to Houston Astros)


Steroid Era: Late 1980's - Early 2000's

Everyone was on PED's

2004 random drug test and players starting getting suspended

2007 Michele report 


Analytics Era: Early 2000s- 2020

Data-driven approach to find undervalued players for scouting


Modern Era:

International talent

Ohtani, acuna, soto

Lots of Rule changes 

Pitch timer - 30 seconds between batters, pitches get 15-20 seconds between pitches
Only 2 maximum disengagements per batter

Pace of games much faster

Infield shift is banned

Bases increased in size
