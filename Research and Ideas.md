## Project Scope

**5 Era-Based Shadow Teams** featuring overlooked players who:
- Are NOT in the Hall of Fame
- Have 30+ career WAR (or equivalent MLE for Negro/International leagues)
- No confirmed PED use
- Good character/compelling story

**Roster per era:** C, 1B, 2B, SS, 3B, LF, CF, RF + Pitchers (era-appropriate)

## Design Ideas

- Collect players' old baseball cards as a profile image

## Selection Criteria

Need to be above 30 WAR.

Add names of people who are not active players who are (not currently in Hall of Fame, and did not take steroids as far as you know, and are good people).

## Relief Pitching Evolution

**Early days (Dead Ball/Live Ball):** Relievers existed but were just failed starters, young guys getting experience, or old guys on the way out. Not valued. Rare exceptions like Firpo Marberry and Ace Adams.

**Late 1940s-1950s (Integration Era):** "Relief ace" concept emerges - Johnny Murphy, Joe Page, Jim Konstanty (led 1950 Phillies to pennant as a reliever).

**Expansion Era:** Role becomes more defined, but still multi-inning "fireman" types.

**1979:** Bruce Sutter creates modern closer role. ESPN.com points to him as the game's first closer, as he was called upon only when his team was in the lead.

**1988:** Tony La Russa + Dennis Eckersley define the modern 9th-inning-only closer role with the Oakland Athletics.

## The Five Eras

### Era 1: Dead Ball Era (1900-1919)

Balls were poorly designed and overused in games. A single baseball would often be in play over 100 pitches. Baseballs got soft so they did not fly as far. Games were slower, less entertaining, more focused on strategy than just playing the game of baseball.

Pitchers were allowed to do whatever they wanted to the ball - scuff it, spit on it, scratch it.

Home runs and base hits were super rare.

Batting average dropped to .239.

Players that got on base bunted, took walks, stole bases.

**Pitching Note:** Relievers not valued in this era. Starters finished their own games. Complete games were the norm.

**Candidates:**
- Chief Wilson - Most triples in a season with 36 in 1912
- Noodles Hahn - Did not reach 10 year minimum but had 44 war

**Shadow Team Roster:**
| Position | Player |
|----------|--------|
| C | |
| 1B | |
| 2B | |
| SS | |
| 3B | |
| LF | |
| CF | |
| RF | |
| SP | |

| SP | |

### Era 2: Live Ball Era (1920-1941)

Extreme rise in offensive statistics, records being broken.

Pitchers were NO longer allowed to manipulate the baseballs. Also, baseballs were to be swapped out during the first sign of wear so they would be easier to see. The balls were not soft because they kept getting changed out, so the balls would go a lot further and be hit harder.

This is when power became the most important batting statistic, as seen with players like Babe Ruth (he is in the Hall of Fame).

**Pitching Note:** Relievers still not valued. Rare exceptions like Firpo Marberry and Ace Adams.

**Note:** Negro Leagues players crucial for this era - use Eric Chalek's MLEs

**Shadow Team Roster:**
| Position | Player |
|----------|--------|
| C | |
| 1B | |
| 2B | |
| SS | |
| 3B | |
| LF | |
| CF | |
| RF | |
| SP | |

### Era 3: Integration Era (1942-1960)

The color barrier begins to be broken in MLB. Jackie Robinson (HOF player) was signed to the Dodgers by GM Branch Rickey.

1947 April 15th - The color barrier was officially broken (Jackie Robinson's first game) with the Brooklyn Dodgers.

Paved the way for future players to get a chance.

Larry Doby, Satchel Paige, Roy Campanella (all 3 HOF).

Latin American players also started to get signed as well. Roberto Clemente (HOF, Puerto Rico).

**Pitching Note:** "Relief ace" concept emerges - Johnny Murphy, Joe Page, Jim Konstanty.

**Note:** Look for Negro League veterans who crossed over late and lost prime years to segregation

**Shadow Team Roster:**
| Position | Player |
|----------|--------|
| C | |
| 1B | |
| 2B | |
| SS | |
| 3B | |
| LF | |
| CF | |
| RF | |
| SP | |
| SP | |
| RP | |

### Era 4: Expansion Era (1961-1976)

A whole bunch of new teams were added.

**Pitching Era (1963-1968):**

Occurred during the Expansion Era.

The strike zone was changed to be significantly bigger due to it now being from the shoulders to the bottom of the knees, instead of where it was before, which was the armpits to the top of the knees.

Pitching domination.

Record low batting average: .237

Major league stars during this time: Sandy Koufax (1.93 ERA and 4 no-hitters and a perfect game in 1963), Bob Gibson (1.12 ERA).

1969 - The pitching mound was lowered from 15 inches to 10 inches.

DH was a new rule that was added.

**Pitching Note:** Relief role becomes more defined. Multi-inning "fireman" types like Hoyt Wilhelm, Elroy Face.

**Shadow Team Roster:**
| Position | Player |
|----------|--------|
| C | |
| 1B | |
| 2B | |
| SS | |
| 3B | |
| LF | |
| CF | |
| RF | |
| SP | |
| SP | |
| RP | |

### Era 5: Free Agent Era (1977-1986)

Players had much more negotiating power and more freedom to choose where to sign.

First million-dollar player: Nolan Ryan ($4.5 million to Houston Astros).

**Pitching Note:** Modern closer born with Bruce Sutter (1979). One-inning save situations become the norm.

**Note:** Last clean era before PED concerns

**Shadow Team Roster:**
| Position | Player |
|----------|--------|
| C | |
| 1B | |
| 2B | |
| SS | |
| 3B | |
| LF | |
| CF | |
| RF | |
| SP | |
| SP | |
| CP | |

## Era NOT Included

### Steroid Era (Late 1980s - Early 2000s)

*Excluded: Too difficult to verify who's clean*

Everyone was on PEDs.

2004 - Random drug tests and players started getting suspended.

2007 - Mitchell Report.
